Hi Adam,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


I have heard from public sources of information that you have an
interest in making the Bible college campus (aka Davis college), put
to public good.


I have an interest in expanding public health, into the Exurban - New
York, Johnson city, NY area. (github.com/irakeshkelm/iirakeshkukatla).


Zoom me a response, or invite me to your place.


Unfortunately, I reside in a very humble private residence (7 Elm
Street, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (aka United slave america aka Romani america).


However, you are most welcome to stop by (at your convenience).


Thank you,
Rakesh.
Independent interest and Militia
USA (aka United slave america aka Romani america).
