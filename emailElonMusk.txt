Rakesh Kukatla - Starlink kit (aka open source kit) and/or TPlink kit
(aka electronical kit)


Hi Elon,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


I, was checking out the Starlink kit that comes with Starlink
satellite internet service.


It would be wonderful, if you could open source the Starlink kit
and/or allow me to use a electronical TPlink kit, to connect to
Starlink satellite internet service.


Unfortunately, I own (aka owner) a very humble private residence (7
Elm Street, Binghamton, NY 13905. USA (Banana republicans aka United
whores, aka Romani; USA = United slave america). And, was planning on
using Starlink satellite internet service from my private (aka owned)
property.


Zoom me a response, at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.
